Hey!

This is the github for Vroomba team ME 72 
The contents of these folders are laid out in the following way:

Vroomba
    |-> Code
    |---> last_yyyymmdd
    |---> last_yyyymmdd
    --> CAD
    |---> last_yyyymmdd
    |---> last_yyyymmdd
    -->README.txt
    -->ME72_DWG_IBARRA

Try to stick to the layout please! 
Mostly we are trying to keep track of how recent a version is 
and who you should ask if you have questions.

All the CAD files are zipped folders with either .stl files 
for 3d printing or solidworks files for design

The ME72_DWG_IBARRA document contains engineering drawings 
for the robot.
